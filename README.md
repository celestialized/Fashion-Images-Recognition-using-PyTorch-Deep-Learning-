What is image recognition? Just like the phrase “What-you-see-is-what-you-get” says, human brains make vision easy. It doesn’t take any effort for humans to tell apart a dog, a cat or a flying saucer. But this process is quite hard for a computer to imitate: they only seem easy because God designs our brains incredibly good in recognizing images. A common example of image recognition is optical character recognition (OCR). A scanner can identify the characters in the image to convert the texts in an image to a text file. With the same process, OCR can be applied to recognize the text of a license plate in an image.
